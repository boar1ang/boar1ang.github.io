        <p>I am currently a student in the Data Analytics and Visualization bootcamp at the University of Minnesota. 
          My background is in library and information science.  I live in Saint Paul and I work for the state as an 
          information governance practitioner.</p>
         <p>I detest cold weather and would like to move as soon as my kids are out of the house. I love IPAs and stoic philosophy; I hate mushrooms, 
           eggplant, and dry skin. I don't do social media.</p>
